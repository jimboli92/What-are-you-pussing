Gautham Oroskar: Why is it that mostly everyone who has invested time and money and effort into tennis during youth so easily gives it up once the realities of adulthood set in?

Gautham Oroskar: Or no Mar 6, 2022, 10:04:26 AM Central Time
Me: Yeah, kinda Mar 6, 2022, 10:04:29 AM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Now it's called wild rice? Mar 6, 2022, 10:04:41 AM Central Time
Me: Now that you say it i do miss the crab rangoons, pot stickers, and fried rice Mar 6, 2022, 10:05:01 AM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: More than Luckys or Quiznos? Mar 6, 2022, 10:05:18 AM Central Time
Me: Idk how many changes it went through, it became Phat Noodles right after my parents sold it and i never knew any other updates Mar 6, 2022, 10:05:41 AM Central Time
Me: Lol yeah, more than “Zno’s” Mar 6, 2022, 10:06:03 AM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Does UIC tennis exist because of capitalism? Or it is altruism? Mar 6, 2022, 10:06:22 AM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Given that UIC tennis makes no money and it consistently loses Mar 6, 2022, 10:07:01 AM Central Time
Me: It exists bc the last person showing up to a knifefight feels like they still need to bring a knife and try to stab someone even if they have no shot of winning Mar 6, 2022, 10:10:41 AM Central Time
Me: O jim schmidt retired Mar 6, 2022, 10:11:09 AM Central Time
Me: And paula allen meares n olomger chancellor
Me: are there any good indian places in the burbs Mar 24, 2022, 12:07:09 PM Central Time

Me: yeah lol Mar 30, 2022, 3:00:18 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: What do you think? Mar 30, 2022, 3:00:45 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Why is it that most players lose interest after college tennis? Or is it just because we live in the wrong place of chicago? Mar 30, 2022, 3:00:50 PM Central Time
Me: idk, i was mostly trying to find places to list myself as a coach or hitting partner. but when i think of it hitting would be nice Mar 30, 2022, 3:01:07 PM Central Time
Me: training sucked too much lol and so does the stress of not playing well Mar 30, 2022, 3:01:08 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Why do you think it is so difficult though? Mar 30, 2022, 3:01:26 PM Central Time
Me: i guess we just want to try some other things after life was all tennis for so long Mar 30, 2022, 3:03:41 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: I just played now Mar 30, 2022, 3:03:49 PM Central Time

Me: i just looked him up, hans hooked you up? Mar 30, 2022, 3:04:32 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Yeah I met him staying in touch with UIC after I left Mar 30, 2022, 3:04:39 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Why is UIC 2-14 this year Mar 30, 2022, 3:04:40 PM Central Time
Me: i appreciate that man, i can't reliably get out there tho using parents' cars, especially playing around when my dad is using the racquets Mar 30, 2022, 3:04:43 PM Central Time
Me: o cool cool Mar 30, 2022, 3:04:52 PM Central Time
Me: lol...ouch Mar 30, 2022, 3:04:58 PM Central Time
Me: did you rub that in hans's face Mar 30, 2022, 3:05:51 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: No, I haven't yet Mar 30, 2022, 3:06:04 PM Central Time
Me: lol Mar 30, 2022, 3:06:20 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Will you do Uber eats today? Mar 30, 2022, 3:07:16 PM Central Time

Gautham Oroskar: When will you start ? Mar 30, 2022, 3:10:17 PM Central Time
Me: i guess i'd take either the 3:54 or the 4:54 downtown Mar 30, 2022, 3:10:29 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Downtown? Mar 30, 2022, 3:10:37 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: I thought you do it in suburbs? Mar 30, 2022, 3:10:37 PM Central Time
Me: i tried it out here monday but it just sucks too much biking in the burbs and ppl weren't happy it took longer than car Mar 30, 2022, 3:10:50 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: How do you transport in downtown then if no car? Mar 30, 2022, 3:10:58 PM Central Time
Me: i did it downtown for the first time sunday, pretty sure i'll only do downtown now Mar 30, 2022, 3:11:00 PM Central Time
Me: divvy bike Mar 30, 2022, 3:11:10 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: And you made some good cash? Mar 30, 2022, 3:11:23 PM Central Time
Me: like $20/hr Mar 30, 2022, 3:11:38 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: For 5-6 hours? Mar 30, 2022, 3:11:46 PM Central Time
Me: 4hrs Mar 30, 2022, 3:12:13 PM Central Time
Me: have you tried the utr flex leagues Mar 30, 2022, 3:12:16 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: How will you get from wiesbrook to Wheaton train station? Mar 30, 2022, 3:12:20 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: No what is that? Mar 30, 2022, 3:12:48 PM Central Time
Me: bike on the prairie path, lock bike at train station bc i dont want to have to bring my bike on the train Mar 30, 2022, 3:12:59 PM Central Time
Me: idk, these leagues that utr runs apparently Mar 30, 2022, 4:59:18 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: When will you leave for downtown Mar 30, 2022, 4:59:40 PM Central Time
Me: I would have about 30 min ago, so I don't think I'll go today Mar 30, 2022, 5:00:23 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: What will you do instread Mar 30, 2022, 5:00:36 PM Central Time
Me: take a shower Mar 30, 2022, 5:01:03 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Do you go to downtown often for Uber eats? Mar 30, 2022, 5:01:25 PM Central Time
Me: sunday was my first time doing it downtown, and it wasn't a trip there just for that. it was bc i spent the night with a friend sat Mar 30, 2022, 7:49:10 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Remember when you played Marx? Mar 30, 2022, 7:49:12 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: 3 and 6? Mar 30, 2022, 7:49:31 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Or when you beat Joblin 4 and 1? Mar 30, 2022, 7:59:51 PM Central Time
Me: Lol, 2 and 6 against marx i think, that first set was so bad Mar 30, 2022, 8:04:34 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Why does Hans suck the life out of players who want to play college tennis? Mar 30, 2022, 8:04:38 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: What is it about Hans? Mar 30, 2022, 8:04:50 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: It seems like Hans takes no blame for his teams results Mar 30, 2022, 8:05:06 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: He keeps telling me that his players suck and are horrible Mar 30, 2022, 8:07:52 PM Central Time
Me: That sucks that he says that, that’s about the worst thing he could say or think Mar 30, 2022, 8:08:57 PM Central Time
Me: Definitely human to want to point the finger elsewhere when things are bad Mar 30, 2022, 8:10:25 PM Central Time
Me: He seems uncomfortable with communicating very directly with people or letting them know exactly where they stand. He seems more comfortable with hearsay and third party communication. So it may be natural for people to lose respect for a leader who won’t tell them things straight Mar 30, 2022, 8:11:11 PM Central Time
Me: He seems like a good networker with a lot of friends, and that communication style has probably served him well in that context Mar 30, 2022, 8:12:22 PM Central Time
Me: I dont know too much about leadership but sometimes i do think back to what the guys would criticize him for and what exactly it is that makes the young men you are leading lose respect for you Mar 30, 2022, 8:15:15 PM Central Time
Me: I dont know too much about other coaches but i think the most inspiring things i’ve eve rheard about them are: I was in the car with kopinski at a summer ita and he took a call with dancer. They didnt talk about tennis all that much despite him being at ita, just more personal conversation. Kopinski later even told me dancer had been challenging him to try to be more outgoing socially, and that he would call all of his players at least once a week through the summer Then, i don’t know if i’m remembering this correctly and if it was someone else, but when i was recruiting, i talked to cris james a few times, and he told me that every week he has a personal private lesson with each of his players Mar 30, 2022, 8:21:05 PM Central Time
Me: So if you were to try to really boil things down to a most fundamental level, maybe it’s a lack of taking responsibility and connecting directly with his players. Sort of like, expecting the people you lead to just know what to do without telling them, and doing it just because that’s what they’re supposed to do A rare breed of people are capable of doing that on their own, but the whole point of athletics is to cultivate character, which comes through relationships. Even if college athletics is business with money involved, the core should still be the bonds and relationships ultimately, not even the tennis. I suppose that’s what inspired me about kopinski’s description of dancer I also will never forget how cris james helped me. When i got the uic offer i had no idea what to do or even what it really was (like the terms of what accepting would even mean). Was weird, i ended up calling cris james bc previously he’d offered me to call him anytime for help...so i did, and told him about the offer. Then even tho it served no benefit to him, he spent like half an hour of the phone with me explaining how an offer works, listening to my feelings, and reassuring me. I was still interested in isu at the time but knew i prob couldnt get money, so when i toldhim about the offer i was like “yeah it sounds like i’d maybe get a spot on isu but without a scholarship right?” And he was straight and said that’s right, and then spent time talking to me. I probably never even properly thanked him for that Mar 30, 2022, 8:22:30 PM Central Time
Me: Dont show this to him or tell him i said this of course, if i can reconcile with him someday i dont want this to be the first he hears from me in a while. But if it influences your ideas when you talk to him ya Mar 30, 2022, 8:24:32 PM Central Time
Me: Probably makes it harder that he’s such a nice guy who people naturally like, bc then it makes ppl wonder if he’s being straight Mar 30, 2022, 8:25:55 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: I won't tell him I promise Mar 30, 2022, 8:26:00 PM Central Time
Me: I was constantly disgusted by ppl talking smack about him behind his back, but then i let go and joined in myself when i felt hurt soph year. But i guess, it’s easier for ppl to talk smack about you when you talk smack about them Mar 30, 2022, 8:26:05 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Sorry I'm working at the hospital, I'll have to read this and respond later Mar 30, 2022, 8:26:22 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: R u just chilling tonight? Mar 30, 2022, 8:26:27 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: How was the shower? Mar 30, 2022, 8:26:35 PM Central Time
Me: Thanks, yeah these are just thoughts Mar 30, 2022, 8:26:56 PM Central Time
Me: And cool. Yeah pretty much and trying to sleep early, shower was pretty good i scrubbed my back
Gautham Oroskar: Is it sad that I cannot find any player to play with me on the internet, despite my pleas? Mar 31, 2022, 2:42:15 PM Central Time
Me: Lol, do they just ignore you? Have you tried utr, i was looking at it yesterday Mar 31, 2022, 2:42:25 PM Central Time
Me: Or the usta leagues
Gautham Oroskar: I have two questions I wanted to ask you. 1) why is it that Rahul Kamath can so easily just completely stop communicating and cease all interest in my friendship with him the minute UIC tennis is done? For over 5 years I haven't said one word to him and he has no interest in maintaining relationships let alone playing tennis. Is he the definition of a conditional friendship? Why do these sort of conditional friendships exist in life, and especially in tennis? 2) why is it that mostly every European or foreign UIC tennis player has left the USA after they finish UIC and go back to their home country? Despite the supposed higher standard of living in the USA, it's not enough for these players to stay in the US compared to where they were born. Why is that? Apr 1, 2022, 12:45:41 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: When will you do today? Apr 1, 2022, 4:54:14 PM Central Time
Me: 1) that hurts man, you guys were really close and took a risk and a journey together, that’s a big chunk of life to just leave in the past as if it doesn’t matter. If it really is that he doesnt have the desire to have any sort of relationship or contact, then that’s sad. There could be all sorts of reasons other than that tho.. just for me, as soon as i failed off the team i still liked everyone of course but was just so ashamed i didnt want to see anyone. I was scared to even go on campus bc i didnt want to run into anyone. Lasted years and years...even a year ago i might not be able to have this conversation with you. When life was bad, i felt too ashamed to talk to anyone, when life was good, i also felt ashamed for it being good when it was the bad that’d affected everyone. Even to this day it’s kind of hard to write happy birthday on facebook to any of our old teammates, i feel ashamed to but push myself to write it bc it’s a birthday. I’d always want to reconcile with hans too but even now i’m pretty sure i’m not ready at all Apr 1, 2022, 4:55:26 PM Central Time
Me: Idk also given tennis was its own bubble maybe the mind just more naturally cuts out the people too vs non-tennis/social relationships that tend to be less contextual Apr 1, 2022, 4:57:50 PM Central Time
Me: 2) being away from home is just super hard..took me a while to realize and admit that. You and i got a small taste of it commuting and just feeling better doing that than living on campus. Ends up just being too human, most people end up not being wired to put those opportunities above home I dont really know and wasnt close by him but wasnt raa kind of depressed from being far away from home Alan and mau to some degree too but at least they had each other Apr 1, 2022, 4:58:27 PM Central Time
Me: We made fun of nico for going wild anytime he saw an old colombian friend but maybe it’s a lot more relatable than we thought Apr 1, 2022, 4:59:07 PM Central Time
Me: At 8:39pm hopefully
Gautham Oroskar: Can you tell me what are your thoughts on this video? What do you think? Apr 2, 2022, 11:15:56 AM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1HaJ2pc-lps Apr 2, 2022, 12:37:32 PM Central Time
Me: he definitely shouldn't have done that, but whatever feelings leading up to that are totally understandable. at some point you're just done, i could definitely see myself snapping like that Apr 2, 2022, 6:21:39 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: What do you think about this scene? Apr 2, 2022, 6:21:40 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dmGlQ5BJhSo Apr 2, 2022, 6:21:48 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: If you've ever seen American beauty Apr 2, 2022, 6:23:50 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dmGlQ5BJhSo
Gautham Oroskar: What are your thoughts? Apr 3, 2022, 1:14:05 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: How do I sell what you’re buying in this world? Apr 3, 2022, 3:10:50 PM Central Time
Me: Up to the outburst I was thinking, "pretty sweet scene". He overreacted for sure as she just pointed something out and wasn't really stopping things by it, but I can relate with both of them. It seemed like outbursts that might look wild in the moment but were probably revealing of long-term, chronic issues and conflicts they've been having Apr 3, 2022, 3:12:44 PM Central Time
Me: I can definitely see him having been fed up tho and that sort of being like the last straw of her always being out of the moment Apr 3, 2022, 3:13:06 PM Central Time
Me: Haven't seen the movie btw Apr 3, 2022, 3:15:49 PM Central Time
Me: She is clearly enjoying the moment after all until seeing the beer Apr 3, 2022, 3:16:50 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: UIC is now 2-16 Apr 3, 2022, 5:16:05 PM Central Time
Me: Lol Apr 3, 2022, 5:16:08 PM Central Time
Me: did you rub it in hans' face Apr 3, 2022, 5:16:17 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Is there an inherent reason why it's year after year losing? Apr 3, 2022, 5:16:34 PM Central Time
Me: overambitious schedule prob Apr 3, 2022, 5:17:27 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Does any of the onus get placed on hans? Apr 3, 2022, 5:17:44 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: But why is it especially in tennis that the same teams win against the same teams every year Apr 3, 2022, 5:17:50 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: The result never changes I mean Apr 3, 2022, 5:17:51 PM Central Time
Me: as the leader and manager yes he has the greatest responsibility Apr 3, 2022, 5:18:14 PM Central Time
Me: combination of the person who is responsible plus the resources available to that person who is responsible Apr 3, 2022, 5:20:51 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: But shouldn't more be expected of the players to improve from Hear to hear? Apr 3, 2022, 5:21:06 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Year to year Apr 3, 2022, 5:21:27 PM Central Time
Me: it's all relative anyway, wins and losses only represent relative results to other teams Apr 3, 2022, 5:22:10 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Correct but UIC is forced to always play the same relative people Apr 3, 2022, 5:23:00 PM Central Time
Me: the other teams are expected to improve too Apr 3, 2022, 5:23:51 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: I would argue valpo and Cleveland state have the same resources as UIC, right? Apr 3, 2022, 5:24:19 PM Central Time
Me: prob close yeah, should be at least within the same conference Apr 3, 2022, 5:24:23 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Yet they are much more competitive against bigger schools than UIC is Apr 3, 2022, 5:24:47 PM Central Time
Me: then ya the other element would the person responsible, so yes i would say the head coach is that person who is the most responsible Apr 3, 2022, 5:24:47 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Do you miss Raa? Apr 3, 2022, 5:24:56 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Or ever think of him Apr 3, 2022, 5:25:17 PM Central Time
Me: lol, i never actually spent that much time with him, i've sort of thought of him the last few weeks since we talked but not really outside of that Apr 3, 2022, 5:25:42 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: What about luiz or Scott Apr 3, 2022, 5:26:03 PM Central Time
Me: i do remember that they basically lied or kept me in the dark about their actual rent price at the condo lol Apr 3, 2022, 5:26:07 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: How do I sell what you’re buying in this world? Apr 3, 2022, 5:26:29 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Why would they do that? Apr 3, 2022, 5:26:35 PM Central Time
Me: luiz ya we messaged a few times, scott not as much but sometimes i do Apr 3, 2022, 5:26:51 PM Central Time
Me: remember when you found out from mau i think who let slip that they pay $500 Apr 3, 2022, 5:27:01 PM Central Time
Me: and before that they kept a tight lid on what the rent was Apr 3, 2022, 5:27:09 PM Central Time
Me: idk, selling and buying what? Apr 3, 2022, 5:30:40 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: So what you're saying is that money often taints or breaks relationships ? Apr 3, 2022, 5:30:44 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: With regards to rent thing Apr 3, 2022, 5:32:01 PM Central Time
Me: naw, not really, that thing was more about honesty, i was the first one who talked to raa about renting, he seemed down, then i started talking about how much i didn't want to party and just wanted to study, other people started getting in, then raa told me "i talked to my parents and they'll prob charge a lot more for rent" bc i'd also talked about as cheap as possible Apr 3, 2022, 5:32:08 PM Central Time
Me: and i think that's why everyone was keeping so mum about the price Apr 3, 2022, 5:32:41 PM Central Time
Me: but no that's not why i think about raa, i guess i don't (or try not to?) think about that period of life that much Apr 3, 2022, 5:34:04 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Yeah, I can imagine why you want to forget that period of your life Apr 3, 2022, 5:34:11 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Did you have a good day? What did you do? Apr 3, 2022, 5:34:52 PM Central Time
Me: woke up late, gagged from the burgers my dad made, read some random stuff, strangely now watching the bill nye - ken ham debate in 2014 on creationism vs evolution Apr 3, 2022, 9:36:46 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: How is it that djokovic became good with less resources than most American tennis player Apr 3, 2022, 9:37:24 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: More humble upbringing
Gautham Oroskar: What do you think? Apr 4, 2022, 4:39:42 PM Central Time
Me: he's good
Me: i want butter chicken so bad
Gautham Oroskar: There is a ghareeb nawaz in the suburbs! Apr 6, 2022, 9:16:20 AM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Would you go to cuisine of India in Naperville with me? Apr 6, 2022, 9:16:30 AM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: For lunch next week? Apr 6, 2022, 11:27:29 AM Central Time
Me: dude...yes. although i was looking at all you can eat buffets, like shikara in downers grove, or india palace in north wheaton Apr 6, 2022, 11:27:49 AM Central Time
Me: i'd looked up the ghareeb nawaz lol. but i might save that for when i go downtown sometime for ubereats Apr 6, 2022, 1:47:33 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: When can you go? Next Tuesday or Wednesday? Apr 6, 2022, 1:47:43 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: For lunch, I can break from Orochem Apr 6, 2022, 1:48:48 PM Central Time

Me: I like that he’s sweet to his kids, doesnt push them into tennis, and if they do play have someone else coach while he just stays dad Apr 6, 2022, 7:11:14 PM Central Time
Me: And really appreciate that offer. Will just depend on schedule, if i can drive myself that’d be best of course and most efficient for time Apr 6, 2022, 7:17:01 PM Central Time

Gautham Oroskar: Okay let's just stick with Tuesday Apr 10, 2022, 8:13:19 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Can you do dinner on Tuesday? Apr 10, 2022, 8:13:23 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Or okay lunch Apr 10, 2022, 8:13:27 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Or only lunch ? Apr 10, 2022, 8:13:43 PM Central Time
Me: dinner would be better, although no buffet lol Apr 10, 2022, 8:13:59 PM Central Time
Me: but i don't need the buffet as badly anymore, i just went to a buffet today (not indian) and i ate enough for a couple days lol Apr 10, 2022, 8:15:19 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: So do you want to do dinner on Tuesday at shikara? Apr 10, 2022, 8:15:26 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Or not even Indian food? Apr 10, 2022, 8:15:42 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: UIC came back from being down 2-0 and won 5-2 Apr 10, 2022, 8:15:57 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: How did djokovic become this good with less resources than any junior at HRC? Apr 10, 2022, 8:16:17 PM Central Time
Me: dinner tuesday at indian place of your choice, my only reason for shikara was the buffet Apr 10, 2022, 8:16:33 PM Central Time
Me: lol nice Apr 10, 2022, 8:18:06 PM Central Time
Me: wow dubs is only a single set now? that sucks Apr 10, 2022, 8:23:20 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Anywhere is fine. Apr 10, 2022, 8:23:31 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Look at the prices of places I don't want you to pay so much for the food Apr 10, 2022, 8:24:00 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Indian food at restaurants is expensive Apr 10, 2022, 8:24:09 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: How did djokovic become this good with less resources than any junior at HRC? Apr 10, 2022, 9:31:29 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Is UIC's comeback win a fluke? Apr 10, 2022, 10:49:27 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Did you still want to do Indian food? Apr 11, 2022, 1:19:38 AM Central Time
Me: yeah man, i will go anywhere with butter chicken Apr 11, 2022, 1:20:25 AM Central Time
Me: will you be in dg or naper? if you're in dg and we're doing dinner we could go to ghareeb nawaz in lombard lol Apr 11, 2022, 1:22:13 AM Central Time
Me: djokovic too much heart, as much as hrc excelled at a lot of things and had great coaches, it actually was not a place that had an ethos of excellence. most players in the super ex groups i'd imagine did not really achieve as much as they wanted to. it was the select few who stood out and really made the most of their experience at hrc who benefitted the most from it Apr 11, 2022, 1:23:07 AM Central Time
Me: basically...if you wanted to play tennis, hrc was great. but, what hrc couldn't do was make you want to play tennis. and too many super ex kids didn't really want to play tennis Apr 11, 2022, 1:26:35 AM Central Time
Me: the culture had some issues (older kids having bad attitudes that would set examples for the younger kids, and the older kids not really being corrected for it), and also i think there was a bit of an identity crisis...definitely some competitive coaches wanted it to be tennis academy-esque, which would have been perfect for a select few players (homeschoolers for example), but for many it just didn't mix well enough to serve suburban competitive tennis players
Gautham Oroskar: Let's just stick with cuisine of India in Naperville for dinne Apr 11, 2022, 2:40:02 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Dinner Apr 11, 2022, 2:40:14 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Fuck ghareeb nawaz in lombard Apr 11, 2022, 2:40:19 PM Central Time
Me: Cool cool Apr 11, 2022, 2:40:25 PM Central Time
Me: Im gonna eat that butter chicken so hard Apr 11, 2022, 2:40:28 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Is that ok? What time will work for you? 630? Apr 11, 2022, 2:40:34 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: What will you do today? Apr 11, 2022, 2:40:45 PM Central Time
Me: Sure that’s good Apr 11, 2022, 2:41:02 PM Central Time
Me: Or we coukd even play tennis first or something since we’re meeting anyway Apr 11, 2022, 2:42:13 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Can you meet me for tennis at Nike park in Naperville before dinner? Apr 11, 2022, 2:42:18 PM Central Time

Me: Yeah that works Apr 11, 2022, 2:43:35 PM Central Time
Me: Fight the war within between wanting to get drunk on video games another day and doing some work Apr 11, 2022, 2:46:20 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Do you have balls? Apr 11, 2022, 2:47:01 PM Central Time
Me: Yeah ive got a couple fresh cans actually Apr 11, 2022, 2:47:44 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Ok please bring one Apr 11, 2022, 2:48:01 PM Central Time
Me: Cool cool Apr 11, 2022, 2:48:41 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Why do people stare at computers and phones for most of the day? Apr 11, 2022, 2:49:16 PM Central Time
Me: convenience Apr 11, 2022, 2:52:00 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: How does Hans Keep his job year after year? Apr 11, 2022, 2:53:07 PM Central Time
Me: who knows but if i had to guess, the costs/risks of hiring someone new aren't worth the potential benefits of a new coach that may or may not materially improve the team's performance Apr 11, 2022, 2:55:58 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Do you remember when you told me that you thought "puss" was an "all-purpose verb?" Apr 11, 2022, 2:56:13 PM Central Time
Me: lol i thought it was? Apr 11, 2022, 2:56:35 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: It was but it was a funny characterization Apr 11, 2022, 2:56:47 PM Central Time
Me: its original intended usage was to describe the action of the protonation of a hydroxyl group Apr 11, 2022, 2:57:03 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Does McDonalds provide value to society? Apr 11, 2022, 2:57:26 PM Central Time
Me: their value meals bring joy to me when i am hungry and want to make bad decisions Apr 11, 2022, 2:57:26 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Cheap readily available food but unhealthy nonetheless Apr 11, 2022, 2:59:34 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Was ray kroc a visionary in life or a thief? Apr 11, 2022, 2:59:53 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Tony Cahill died last year Apr 11, 2022, 3:00:18 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: It's important not to idolize these tennis coaches, they were never amazingly good at tennis themselves Apr 11, 2022, 3:01:15 PM Central Time
Me: Wow, I don't remember hearing that at all Apr 11, 2022, 3:01:38 PM Central Time
Me: I don't know much about Ray Kroc but if he was unscrupulous and immoral in his practices I don't know if thief would be the best descriptor Apr 11, 2022, 3:02:10 PM Central Time
Me: Yeah it ends up being pretty rare for people who actually played on the pro tour to become coaches Apr 11, 2022, 3:02:31 PM Central Time
Me: or maybe ^ statement is incorrect and it's more that there is such a small crop of ex-pro players that we happened to not see any Apr 11, 2022, 6:45:13 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Why do people exist? Apr 11, 2022, 11:10:25 PM Central Time
Me: Bc God the Father loved God the Son, and humanity was the byproduct of that love that fulfilled a promise that the Father made to the Son Apr 11, 2022, 11:11:30 PM Central Time
Me: From a physically causal basis, because our species happened to be evolutionarily successful enough to live right now
Me: dude i'm worried, i don't see butter chicken on the cuisine of india menu lol Apr 12, 2022, 2:05:05 AM Central Time
Me: dude...i did ubereats for 4 hours today and am hungry again lol. would you kill me if i wanted to go to shikara for lunch buffet instead again? a google review said $15 for buffet lol. we can still play tennis later too
Gautham Oroskar: They do have butter chicken. Apr 12, 2022, 10:48:50 AM Central Time
Me: oo nice nice Apr 12, 2022, 10:48:53 AM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Dinner would work better for me. Let me know if you cannot do dinner. We can reschedule. Apr 12, 2022, 10:49:44 AM Central Time
Me: cool cool. are weekends open for you at all? morning tennis then lunch buffet? Apr 12, 2022, 10:53:04 AM Central Time
Me: wait tonight is good tho we can do that, buffet another time Apr 12, 2022, 10:54:53 AM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Okay sounds good. Do you want to meet at 6 pm at Nike park to play for 30 minutes, then we can go to dinner at cuisine of india? Same plan? Apr 12, 2022, 10:55:05 AM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Generally yes I can meet most weekends too. Apr 12, 2022, 10:55:10 AM Central Time
Me: lolol sounds good Apr 12, 2022, 10:55:17 AM Central Time
Me: cool cool Apr 12, 2022, 10:55:25 AM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: I just have something today at noon that's why I can't do lunch today Apr 12, 2022, 10:55:52 AM Central Time
Me: no worries man, yeah weekend lunches generally better than weekday lunches for me Apr 12, 2022, 10:56:06 AM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Okay so I'll see you tonight? Apr 12, 2022, 10:56:14 AM Central Time
Me: yup, see you there Apr 12, 2022, 10:56:22 AM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: 6 pm Nike park? Can you bring a can of balls? I don't have any today unfortunately Apr 12, 2022, 10:56:40 AM Central Time
Me: 30 min lol. funny to think that actually is an appropriate length of time, my body will prob be torn up Apr 12, 2022, 10:56:43 AM Central Time
Me: yup i got it Apr 12, 2022, 10:57:05 AM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Can you tell me something? Why do conditional friendships exist in life? Apr 12, 2022, 10:57:27 AM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Why did most of our tennis friendships end the minute our tennis season or school year ended? Apr 12, 2022, 10:57:53 AM Central Time
Me: human limitations on love. in a more specific context to our modern lifestyles, convenience mostly Apr 12, 2022, 10:58:36 AM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Raa or Mauricio or Alan Reifer or Rahul Kamath have no incentive to maintain relationships with me even after all the laughter and joy and emotions that were shared. Yet they will surely respond in an hours notice to their boss. Why is that? Apr 12, 2022, 11:00:00 AM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Can you explain that to me? Apr 12, 2022, 11:03:03 AM Central Time
Me: dang dude...have they been largely ignoring you when you've reached out over the years? that hurts. yeah it sucks, i've generally been a proponent of all the modern luxuries and comforts we have all being good things, but maybe there is value to the theory that humans were only ever meant to know 30-50 people in their hunter-gatherer bands. some sort of limitation to the social space in our brains Apr 12, 2022, 11:05:00 AM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Should they feel ashamed in some sense? Apr 12, 2022, 11:05:30 AM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Or the minute Hans no longer needs you to win for UIC tennis, there is no need for him to maintain relations with you? Apr 12, 2022, 11:09:06 AM Central Time
Me: i don't know, i tend to struggle taking a moralistic view of people's actions rather than a causal one. maybe it's because if i were to focus primarily on moralizing my own actions, then i would be too crushed to live with myself Apr 12, 2022, 11:10:43 AM Central Time
Me: yeah, i think a great coach would be one who understands that the true purpose of sports is the development of character and relationships, with the sport just being a medium for that. sort of like the point of family dinner being to have family time together, not the food itself. in that regard, the followup relationship after the tennis experience would probably be even more important than the relationship during. bc that's what will last after a fleeting few years of the tennis itself Apr 12, 2022, 11:11:19 AM Central Time
Me: i'd imagine based on what kopinski told me about dancer, that he might be one who regularly checks in on his former players and values maintaining relationships with them Apr 12, 2022, 11:13:02 AM Central Time
Me: hans kinda strikes me as the kind of guy who prefers to "stick with the program" tho, and focus on "doing what you should" and not necessarily going for a personal idea of what is best but rather being responsible staying in his lane. so he's kinda like into the stuff that a coach "should" be doing, just because, and sort of expecting his players to do what they "should" do, just because Apr 12, 2022, 11:26:02 AM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: What about Alex Raa, Mauricio, Rahul Kamath, Alan Reifer? Apr 12, 2022, 11:26:14 AM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Brian or Andy Page. Should they feel any shame? Apr 12, 2022, 3:33:26 PM Central Time
Me: feel ashamed? Apr 12, 2022, 3:33:43 PM Central Time
Me: idk i am generally not one who has a keen sense of what should happen or who should feel good or bad Apr 12, 2022, 3:58:17 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: You will bring balls right? Apr 12, 2022, 3:58:25 PM Central Time
Me: yup lol Apr 12, 2022, 3:59:06 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: How is your day Apr 12, 2022, 3:59:09 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: What are you doing Apr 12, 2022, 3:59:58 PM Central Time
Me: wasting time on facebook and reddit discussing things things that don't matter, was just commenting on  a post about asian parents and then talking about a visual novel with other people Apr 12, 2022, 4:00:31 PM Central Time
Me: hard to not just pat myself on the back for actually doing some work yesterday and then just idling today Apr 12, 2022, 5:41:59 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Did you leave yet or no? Apr 12, 2022, 5:42:59 PM Central Time
Me: about to, just put on my shorts Apr 12, 2022, 5:44:08 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Can you meet at 615? Apr 12, 2022, 5:44:23 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Running a tad bit late Apr 12, 2022, 5:44:25 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Lmk Apr 12, 2022, 5:47:05 PM Central Time
Me: Oo gotcha. Ya sure Apr 12, 2022, 5:48:36 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Thanks Apr 12, 2022, 5:49:39 PM Central Time
Me: just take your time and let me know whenever you're ready to leave Apr 12, 2022, 5:54:40 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Ok will do Apr 12, 2022, 5:54:42 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Thanks man Apr 12, 2022, 5:54:53 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: I'll text you like 10 min before I will leave Orochem Apr 12, 2022, 5:54:57 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Is that ok? Apr 12, 2022, 5:55:21 PM Central Time
Me: yeah that's perfect man, google maps says 8min drive for me Apr 12, 2022, 5:56:05 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Thanks man Apr 12, 2022, 6:31:03 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Okay I'm leaving Orochem in 10 min Apr 12, 2022, 6:31:08 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: I'll be at Nike park in 15 min Apr 12, 2022, 6:31:21 PM Central Time
Me: cool cool i'll leave now Apr 12, 2022, 6:41:02 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Bring the balls, thanks I'll see you soon
Gautham Oroskar: When are you free for tennis next? Apr 13, 2022, 8:09:51 AM Central Time
Me: prob next week, maybe friday if i'm not doing ubereats Apr 13, 2022, 8:35:42 AM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: What will you do today? Apr 13, 2022, 8:49:28 AM Central Time
Me: Weekly therapy session, hoping to go in to sellplasma if yhey’ve received my docs from doc Apr 13, 2022, 8:50:48 AM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: What do you think about this scene? Apr 13, 2022, 8:52:50 AM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9UspZGJ-TrI Apr 13, 2022, 8:59:47 AM Central Time
Me: there's a few different things going on, interesting Apr 13, 2022, 9:19:16 AM Central Time
Me: i think i've found that most people actually do not want to get rich. almost everyone would say it'd be nice to have a million dollars, but most don't want/can't do the things necessary to get there. this isn't a commentary on actions not matching up with words - i think most people are conscious about this and don't have any ambitions or delusions about getting rich, nor would they even say that they want to get rich the asian guy is interesting, pretty cool illustration of someone who *does* want to get rich and thinks they can but then gets a taste of reality the sales tactic, i suck at sales, but i read an article breaking down the correct answer is to convince the person is right for the pen, not the other way around. first question is, "how long have you been in the market for a pen?" then ask what the person needs Apr 13, 2022, 10:41:15 AM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Do you find it strange that without hesitation I quite readily remembered wiesbrook? Apr 13, 2022, 11:22:36 AM Central Time
Me: lol, your memory is definitely strong, strong enough to be called "strange" as defined as not what might normally be expected
Gautham Oroskar: What will you do today? Apr 14, 2022, 4:18:31 PM Central Time
Me: about to go run some ubereats like i did yesterday Apr 14, 2022, 4:18:39 PM Central Time
Me: hopefully it helps me drop some pounds Apr 14, 2022, 4:18:44 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: When will u reach downtown Apr 14, 2022, 4:18:57 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Is capitalism a necessary evil in life? Apr 14, 2022, 4:19:06 PM Central Time
Me: leave home at 4:30 to bike on prairie path to take the 4:54 which arrives at otc at 5:50 Apr 14, 2022, 4:19:25 PM Central Time
Me: i don't know about "necessary" but it seems to be the system that has won out Apr 14, 2022, 4:19:33 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Once u reach otc, what will u do Apr 14, 2022, 4:19:37 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Find bike? Apr 14, 2022, 4:20:20 PM Central Time
Me: pee and then turn on the app, most likely the divvy station at otc will have an ebike Apr 14, 2022, 4:20:36 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Why has it won out?? Apr 14, 2022, 4:56:29 PM Central Time
Me: If asking what evidence there is for previous answer, then ownership of means of production has tended to bring dominance in market power and share of profits If asking why it has turned out that way, i suppose it began with the dawn of civilization and starting of economic surplus. Positions of power tended to be equipped to consolidating their power and having control over the distribution of profits. A national government could be viewed as the prototype of a capitalist system, in which the profits are centralized and controlled Apr 14, 2022, 4:57:50 PM Central Time
Me: Perhaps most concisely, capitalism has prospered due to land ownership, which exists because we settled from a nomadic life Apr 14, 2022, 8:45:21 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: How was Uber eats? Apr 14, 2022, 8:45:31 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: When will you head back to otc towards wiesbrook? Apr 14, 2022, 9:48:16 PM Central Time
Me: Just got on the train..tired. Also i got a negative feedback which is my third so i’m a bit worried Apr 14, 2022, 9:59:06 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: What kind of negative feedback? What did they say? Apr 14, 2022, 9:59:35 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Don't be worried, I'm sure the next time you do this you'll improve Apr 14, 2022, 9:59:46 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: What will you do once you reach wiesbrook? Apr 14, 2022, 10:05:58 PM Central Time
Me: Thanks man. Nothing written that I can see. I’ve been pretty timely, but i’m using my old backpack so maybe the food is sloshing around not being able to lay flat, or maybe the inside of my backpack is making disgusting smells seep into the food. Sucks, i gotta get a real delivery bag but haven’t wanted to pay for one yet Apr 14, 2022, 10:06:31 PM Central Time
Me: Try not to stay up super late, ideally go to bed right away but if my online friends are on there’s a chance i will stay up late Apr 14, 2022, 10:06:47 PM Central Time
Me: And eat the $5 sub i got from jewel Apr 14, 2022, 10:43:49 PM Central Time

Gautham Oroskar: Do you have any thoughts? Apr 16, 2022, 12:10:35 PM Central Time
Me: Lol Apr 16, 2022, 12:10:55 PM Central Time
Me: Maybe hans has the same problem i had as a college student, refusing to take an easier schedule Apr 16, 2022, 12:10:59 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Is Covid a product of capitalism? Apr 16, 2022, 12:11:38 PM Central Time
Me: In some ways, yes, you could say of the many factors playing into the pandemic, capitalism is a big one Apr 16, 2022, 12:11:38 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: What are some of the reasons you think old teammates don't care much to keep in touch with each other? Apr 16, 2022, 12:12:27 PM Central Time
Me: For one, without capitalism global travel may not be as accessible as it is, so covid may have stayed endemic without it Apr 16, 2022, 12:13:09 PM Central Time
Me: Fear, comfort, insecurity, convenience Apr 16, 2022, 12:25:01 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Are you going to otc today for Uber eats? Apr 16, 2022, 12:25:44 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: What gives a clothing product value or allure? Why are people drawn more to Chanel or Gucci than a clothing item sold at Walmart or goodwill? Apr 16, 2022, 3:31:58 PM Central Time

Me: Visual novels and mcdonalds Apr 16, 2022, 10:33:19 PM Central Time
Me: Branding power is pretty strong Apr 16, 2022, 10:33:25 PM Central Time
Me: Uic’s schedule is too tough Apr 16, 2022, 10:33:59 PM Central Time
Me: Gotta fill that thing up with unranked d3 teams, just like wright state did that year to get joblin undefeated Apr 16, 2022, 10:52:11 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: But you beat joblin, 4 and 1 Apr 16, 2022, 10:52:14 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Right? Apr 16, 2022, 10:52:32 PM Central Time
Me: Lol, ya Apr 16, 2022, 10:52:45 PM Central Time
Me: But wright state did amazing that year Apr 16, 2022, 10:52:57 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Was that the correct score? Apr 16, 2022, 10:53:06 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: What will you do tomorrow Apr 16, 2022, 10:53:21 PM Central Time
Me: One of things i strongly agree with jack sharpe on is ifs important to keep a good win loss ratio Apr 16, 2022, 10:53:25 PM Central Time
Me: I think so Apr 16, 2022, 10:55:39 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: What did you eat for dinner? Apr 16, 2022, 10:55:48 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Can you play again next week? Apr 16, 2022, 10:55:56 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Why is having a good win loss ratio important? Apr 17, 2022, 1:47:01 AM Central Time
Me: practice makes perfect, when you lose too much you get used to losing Apr 17, 2022, 1:47:20 AM Central Time
Me: uic players who get used to losing so much don't play to win anymore. they play to lose in a way that looks less bad Apr 17, 2022, 1:47:45 AM Central Time
Me: mcD Apr 17, 2022, 1:51:32 AM Central Time
Me: and ya we could go for like monday or wed since they dont have matches those days and should wrap up around 5
Gautham Oroskar: What do you think about this scene? What are your thoughts Apr 17, 2022, 1:07:43 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Jx-fnR5G1cs Apr 17, 2022, 1:16:55 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: This is a shorter clip if you have less time. Apr 17, 2022, 1:17:07 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zbLZgmoNnEk Apr 17, 2022, 1:37:56 PM Central Time
Me: i haven't seen the movie, but it's about a vietnam vet who comes home right? i'm sure that was a very intense experience for him. war makes people question everything, especially the cause and purpose of war itself. if the idea of serving his country kept him going...browsing the supermarket isle must have baffling and confusing in wondering if *this* is what he and his brothers on the battlefield are sacrificing their own bodies for Apr 17, 2022, 1:38:32 PM Central Time
Me: his conversation with his baby i think sort of hints at the most visible things being distracting and blocking what is most important but unseen Apr 17, 2022, 1:41:04 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Is he questioning the purpose of having 600 different cereal brands to choose from in an American store? Apr 17, 2022, 1:43:18 PM Central Time
Me: yeah, but i think going further, this is what he's feeding his children, he's met with this wide display right in front of him, it's like the aisle is sort of implying to him that the most important decision he can make for his child is what cereal to feed them. rather than choices of substance such as how to teach, how to love. it's all just fake to him, when he's seen the sacrifices that have enabled that grocery store aisle
Gautham Oroskar: What are you doing? Apr 18, 2022, 9:19:12 PM Central Time
Me: taxes lol Apr 18, 2022, 9:19:35 PM Central Time

Me: Nah not today Apr 19, 2022, 3:42:01 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: What will you do Apr 19, 2022, 3:42:07 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: After reddit Apr 19, 2022, 3:42:54 PM Central Time
Me: Either visual novel, try to nap, go to jewel, have a crying session, or maybe a little bit of work. It’s up in the air Apr 19, 2022, 3:51:42 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Did you file taxes? Apr 19, 2022, 3:51:56 PM Central Time
Me: lol actually i did Apr 19, 2022, 3:51:57 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Do you think you'll ever step foot at Hinsdale racquet club again? Apr 19, 2022, 3:52:13 PM Central Time
Me: except IL requires registering and getting a letter ID in the mail in order to file online...so i didn't do that yet Apr 19, 2022, 3:52:26 PM Central Time
Me: lol, in the course of my lifetime, i would say that is likely, yes

Gautham Oroskar: What will you now do this evening? Apr 24, 2022, 6:02:21 PM Central Time
Me: it was good i was a little worried that she messed up the stick because she changed direction of the needle partway through but it all ended up going smoothly, no infiltration, so i guess it was good Apr 24, 2022, 6:02:33 PM Central Time
Me: prob play a visual novel and talk to internet friends, then pick my mom up from work Apr 24, 2022, 6:08:07 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Can you play tennis this week? Apr 24, 2022, 6:08:17 PM Central Time
Me: tomorrow? Apr 24, 2022, 6:08:23 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Is academia and formal education a scam in general? Apr 24, 2022, 6:08:32 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Thursday Friday Apr 24, 2022, 6:08:45 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: I can even meet you at Wws during my lunch break to play Apr 24, 2022, 6:09:21 PM Central Time
Me: a bad deal for many people, yes, a system originally created on the intention to take advantage of people, no Apr 24, 2022, 6:09:43 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Is capitalism ruthless? Apr 24, 2022, 6:09:47 PM Central Time
Me: tomorrow i know i could do like wws at 5, lunch break sure tomorrow or wed or fri Apr 24, 2022, 6:10:18 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Is feudalism prefereabke? No such thing as education or social constructs of wealth ? Apr 24, 2022, 6:10:19 PM Central Time
Me: yes, i would say so. at the same time it is because nature is ruthless that the choice to be altruistic exists Apr 24, 2022, 6:10:44 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Would McDonald's Exist without capitalism? Apr 24, 2022, 6:11:10 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Does McDonald's provide a benefit to society v Apr 24, 2022, 6:11:11 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: ? Apr 24, 2022, 6:12:21 PM Central Time
Me: i think feudalism depended on frequent warring and essentially flourished for the same reasons capitalism flourishes. there was the same degree of rent-seeking, although i believe today's capitalistic system brings much greater social mobility than feudalism did and is somewhat less nepotistic Apr 24, 2022, 6:13:12 PM Central Time
Me: mcdonald's, probably not. i suppose you could point to mcdonald's quality control and convenience as products of a ruthless approach to efficiency Apr 24, 2022, 6:34:05 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Like you'd never donate plasma out altruism would you? Apr 24, 2022, 6:34:13 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: What would the incentive be? Apr 24, 2022, 6:34:42 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: The ability for McDonald's to provide cheap, consistent unhealthy and tasty food to American consumers is a simple product of capitalism. Apr 24, 2022, 6:35:04 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Americans want to stretch their dollar as far as possible to fill their stomachs, even if it causes diabetes obesity and high cholesterol. Apr 24, 2022, 6:35:16 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: And McDonald's fills that need, is that correct? Apr 24, 2022, 6:36:05 PM Central Time
Me: prob not because it's pretty costly in what i need to do to prepare and recuperate, but i have donated platelets and whole blood several times. i think i did a gallon of whole blood in 2018 Apr 24, 2022, 6:50:42 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Was ray Kroc a visionary in society or a thief who stole the McDonald's brothers idea? Apr 24, 2022, 6:51:06 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Is it analogous to how Elon musk actually did not start Tesla, he simply bought it out and managed it to success?
Gautham Oroskar: What are you doing? Apr 26, 2022, 10:06:31 AM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Why does wiesbrook exist? Apr 26, 2022, 10:07:14 AM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Why did osama bin laden have great disdain for America and Americans? Apr 26, 2022, 10:18:31 AM Central Time
Me: just woke up, waiting for a bit before i poop Apr 26, 2022, 10:19:04 AM Central Time
Me: not even sure if bin laden himself personally had all that hatred or was just playing a role. i think it's pretty clear he loved american pop culture and media Apr 26, 2022, 10:47:00 AM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: What do you mean playing a role? What role? Apr 26, 2022, 10:47:34 AM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: How was the poop? Apr 26, 2022, 10:58:26 AM Central Time
Me: pretty relieving, not a terrible wipe either. feel much better Apr 26, 2022, 10:58:46 AM Central Time
Me: well, seizing power/opportunity basically by voicing what the people were already feeling Apr 26, 2022, 11:13:10 AM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Why were people feeling that way? Because of the bullying hand of America imposed on small middle eastern countries? Apr 26, 2022, 11:13:52 AM Central Time
Me: probably yeah the perception of bullying, hypocrisy, and jealousy toward the perception of americans and american life Apr 26, 2022, 11:22:54 AM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: But is American life really something to be jealous of? Apr 26, 2022, 11:23:18 AM Central Time
Me: no, not really. but perception can make us jealous of just about anything Apr 26, 2022, 11:23:21 AM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: McDonald's at every corner? Hans Neufeld leading men for 20 years? Everything being about work to earn money? Apr 26, 2022, 11:23:34 AM Central Time
Me: lol Apr 26, 2022, 11:23:38 AM Central Time
Me: i want some mcD right now Apr 26, 2022, 11:24:04 AM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Would McDonald's exist in an altruistic only setting? Apr 26, 2022, 11:24:07 AM Central Time
Me: hard choice if i got to pick between mcD and butter chicken right now. i love butter chicken and would probably choose it usually but i'm kind of ceraving McD Apr 26, 2022, 11:24:44 AM Central Time
Me: lol. an altruistic-only setting feels impossible to conceptualize because it would be a world with a fundamentally different human nature Apr 26, 2022, 11:25:29 AM Central Time
Me: and to change human nature you would have to either change the starting conditions that produced human nature as is, so basically changing all of nature, even down to the origin of life possibly, unless God created on the spot Apr 26, 2022, 11:27:05 AM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Is it fair that we are forced into capitalism and are basically required to accept it from birth without a real other option? Apr 26, 2022, 12:06:43 PM Central Time
Me: i dont' know about fairness, since that ended the moment we were born. but yes there is so much about our circumstances that we have no power to choose
Gautham Oroskar: Why would America perceived to be a place foreigners would be jealous of? Apr 26, 2022, 8:36:55 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: If you have to encounter people like Hans Apr 26, 2022, 8:38:09 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Talking about our bin laden conversation? Apr 26, 2022, 9:13:53 PM Central Time
Me: lol. because anyone can project anything onto anyone Apr 26, 2022, 9:25:42 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: What will you do this evening Apr 26, 2022, 9:25:59 PM Central Time

Gautham Oroskar: Did Tony Cahill's career as a tennis professional teaching tennis in the USA contribute to his early death? Apr 27, 2022, 7:52:30 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: As opposed to say if he were a professional tennis player. Apr 27, 2022, 7:52:33 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: ? Apr 27, 2022, 7:52:42 PM Central Time

Me: so good
Me: Is this a product of capitalism? May 2, 2022, 9:22:13 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Yes May 2, 2022, 9:22:18 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: What are your thoughts? May 2, 2022, 9:22:36 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: But is it good for society? That is the question May 2, 2022, 9:23:58 PM Central Time
Me: Something something 7% inflation rate May 2, 2022, 9:24:09 PM Central Time
Me: Fantastic for me, since i’m in debt May 2, 2022, 9:24:27 PM Central Time
Me: Bring on the inflation lol, i don’t mind May 2, 2022, 9:24:55 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Is the health risk posed by fast food offset by its affordability to the masses? May 2, 2022, 9:25:07 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Did ray Kroc contribute something valuable to society? May 2, 2022, 9:25:48 PM Central Time
Me: No definitely not, it’s more expensive than groceries, enables bad eating habits i guess May 2, 2022, 9:26:37 PM Central Time
Me: But there is value in being on the road or somewhere far from home and being able to have confidence in knowing that if you see mcd you can reliably get a filling delicious meal May 2, 2022, 9:27:23 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Does capitalism force consumers to chose options like mcd? May 2, 2022, 9:27:58 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: You doing Uber eats have very little cash for a sit down restaurant, thus your options are essentially squeezed into McDonald's May 2, 2022, 9:28:04 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: ? May 2, 2022, 9:30:10 PM Central Time
Me: Force is a very strange word, technically we always have a choice although when itcomes to human behavior it’s a bit complex. I’m never forced to eat out, i could always choose to eat groceries instead May 2, 2022, 9:30:43 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: When you're doing Uber eats, do you have time to stop for groceries? May 2, 2022, 9:31:04 PM Central Time
Me: McD is no longer good value tho lol. $2.65 for mcchicken, $2.99 for mcdouble...sad. Panda express is better value now esp when i fo the receipt survey and i can get 2 entrees for the price of 1 May 2, 2022, 9:31:23 PM Central Time
Me: Normally i don’t stop at all while doing it, back to back orders May 2, 2022, 9:31:44 PM Central Time

Gautham Oroskar: When Ryan Kunz and I were in high school, we would both bitch and complain why Chuck Enge was our high school tennis coach. We would make fun of him and wish he were gone. When he got fired before my sophomore year of high school, Ryan's Facebook status changed to: "Ryan is sad that Enge is gone." What is the psychology behind that? May 7, 2022, 6:15:10 PM Central Time
Me: Kind of hits different when someone is really gone and you go to the places you used to see them at, but they're not there anymore May 7, 2022, 8:43:00 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: What did you do today? May 7, 2022, 8:43:04 PM Central Time

Me: Familiarity reveals flaws because of our inherently flawed nature

Gautham Oroskar: Is McDonald's successful because the food is cheap? May 22, 2022, 1:49:30 PM Central Time
Me: that could be one factor, but being cheap alone cannot makea business or product successful. i think based on what i remember reading mcdonalds set entirely new standards of quality control that were unmatched at the time and might still be in fast food May 22, 2022, 8:58:49 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Why did Kyle Dawson constantly overachieve in important moments in our junior tennis timeframe? May 22, 2022, 9:11:06 PM Central Time

Me: perhaps indirectly, social and cultural dynamics that can't be unlinked from the influence of capitalism May 26, 2022, 4:09:34 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Capitalism forces mental stress on humans, causing them to be withdrawn and angry and society. No choice but to resort to violence May 26, 2022, 4:10:02 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: If people didn't have to work and think about money to survive all day, they wouldn't feel withdrawn and angry at society May 26, 2022, 4:26:38 PM Central Time
Me: take your time btw and i have a few balls May 26, 2022, 4:34:15 PM Central Time

Gautham Oroskar: Do you feel any slightest bit of sadness or emotion that where you once played a tennis tournament is Now concrete, pavement, a parking lot that houses cars ? May 27, 2022, 1:02:09 PM Central Time

If like wheaton sport center or hrc was demolished i think i would definitely feel something right away
Gautham Oroskar: Is there a reason that Hinsdale Central always wins in high school boys tennis? Is it partly due to the money, resource disparity that people in that area devote to tennis? Is that fair? May 30, 2022, 12:14:44 PM Central Time
Me: I think culture is the primary reason. There is a tennis culture there, so many more people play. This culture could certainly be the result of money, but i would point to the culture as the intrinsic factor May 30, 2022, 12:48:59 PM Central Time

Gautham Oroskar: Is pest control a product of capitalism? Sep 11, 2023, 11:21:01 AM Central Time
Me: God the father loved God the son and humanity was a byproduct of his promise to him. Physically, modern humans arose from the culmination of billions of years of random molecular events, and about 6000 years ago God breathed the breath of life into Adam and created Eve, making the first man out of the homo sapiens animal Sep 11, 2023, 11:21:13 AM Central Time

Gautham Oroskar: Is pest control more capitalistic than Hinsdale racquet club? Sep 11, 2023, 11:29:42 AM Central Time
Me: hrc definitely more capitalistic because there is way more capital involved Sep 11, 2023, 11:29:55 AM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Where in pest control actually provides a tangible service to humans to live, Hinsdale racquet club sells falsehoods about a juniors chances at advancing economically via professional tennis, and charges parents $100 per hour to sell such falsehoods. Sep 11, 2023, 11:30:15 AM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: In that case HRC is more greedy, evil, and capitalistic, correct? Sep 11, 2023, 11:31:07 AM Central Time
Me: lolol Sep 11, 2023, 11:31:18 AM Central Time
Me: perhaps Sep 11, 2023, 11:31:43 AM Central Time
Me: although pest control/contracting businesses could be more greedy and evil when they don't provide quite as much of a benefit to the workers besides taking a cut Sep 11, 2023, 11:32:16 AM Central Time

Gautham Oroskar: No lol, it's okay. Oct 17, 2023, 10:00:06 AM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: I guess your money is spread out over the month with the pass so if they check it every other day and miss one day you still are saving money as opposed to the 10 rides Oct 17, 2023, 10:00:19 AM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: I am free to play tennis Tuesday through Friday this week in the evenings at Nike park. Oct 17, 2023, 10:00:27 AM Central Time

Me: Playing video games about yakuza
Gautham Oroskar: Why does familiarity breed contempt? Nov 13, 2023, 9:52:09 AM Central Time
Me: I believe that principle is incomplete on its own Nov 13, 2023, 9:52:38 AM Central Time
Me: The closer we are with someone, the more we reflect ourselves off them, and the more we can see what is uncomfortable to see
Me: Tennis tomorrow? I'll drive to hrc Dec 2, 2023, 2:45:56 PM Central Time

Me: Bc sports are racist and just don't make Indians feel welcome, theyre all just bigots who don't value diversity, they should be making indian-only leagues to encourage inclusion Feb 13, 2025, 1:28:51 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Why is there no quota for Indians in the professional sports leagues in the USA?

Gautham Oroskar: Tell me what you puss about this Time in education to become an interventional and structural cardiologist: 13 years of elementary/middle/high school 4 years undergraduate college 4 years medical school 3 years internal medicine residency 3 years general cardiology fellowship 2 years interventional and structural cardiology fellowship Average interventional and structural cardiologist salary: $700,000 USD for working and slogging away as a doctor for the entire year and an extra 12 YEARS of intense education. Versus Time for Jeff Bezos education, founder of Amazon 13 years of elementary/middle/high school 4 years undergraduate college Average increase in net worth for Bezos in 2023: $70 billion dollars, equivalent to $200 million dollars per day, or $8 million dollars per hour. So in one hour, Jeff Bezos made 10 times more money than what a structural cardiologist makes in one year. What does that say about the value of education in terms of creating massive wealth and making substantial amounts of money?

Me: Capitalism is about capital, if the only capital you own is your own skills and education, then you are just a wage worker no matter how skilled. Pro athletes get rich through their salaries, but they don't become wealthy unless they use their capital Mar 1, 2025, 11:01:44 AM Central Time

Gautham Oroskar: Explain something to me…if trump is such a lunatic and creating havoc in the government…why did most of the USA vote for him, both popular and electoral? They knew he was a nutcase before he was elected, yet people embraced his bizzare behavior Does that point to how shitty of a job Biden and Harris did? The mainstream media write all these articles stating how terrible his actions are, but no one wants to answer the uncomfortable question that most of the country voted for him…. Mar 2, 2025, 11:54:55 AM Central Time
Me: Identity politics were just swinging way too far for people to be able to stomach anymore Mar 2, 2025, 11:56:02 AM Central Time
Me: The detractors will instead claim the election was lost bc all trump voters are stupid and don't actually know he was gonna do what he's doing

Gautham Oroskar: What do you gaw? Mar 4, 2025, 4:56:12 PM Central Time
Me: Erosion of social values and economic deficit definitely contribute. I think the proportion of trump voters who hate his personality are a small minority Mar 4, 2025, 4:56:48 PM Central Time
Me: Last month has shown this country was literally headed toward complete collapse within 20 years. The country is legitimately being rescued right now from certain death Mar 4, 2025, 4:59:26 PM Central Time
Me: Dei was meant to help poor blacks but it was completely hijacked by Rich blacks and LGBTq. Poor blacks were left in the dust Mar 4, 2025, 5:01:10 PM Central Time
Me: Deficit was and still might be bringing us to a default and total collapse. Not even mentioning draining the swamp, biggest racket in history Mar 4, 2025, 5:01:22 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: I think you’re spot on. Said it well and eloquently. To add I think that Biden and Harris made people feel inadequate when they talked. Especially Harris. Trump, although erratic and bizarre, and comical, tries to resonate with the common man much better. He doesn’t come off as an elitist like Harris did. I also think that nowadays people really only vote fiscally. All these things like Ukraine and Gaza doesn’t really affect their personal life meaningfully, so the longer these things dragged on, the more it became a nuisance for most Americans, and when you couple that with gas reaching $6 per gallon because of that conflict, Americans partly blamed the Biden administration, which only further garnered support for trump Mar 4, 2025, 5:01:35 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Trump takes advantage of people’s plight psychologically. And whether it’s fair or not, peoples plight are eventually blamed on the current administration. Mar 4, 2025, 5:04:18 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: So what do you gaw? Do you support trump or no? Mar 4, 2025, 5:04:41 PM Central Time

Gautham Oroskar: ? Mar 4, 2025, 5:07:39 PM Central Time
Me: China achieving economic parity with the us by 2030 I think is a very real possibility, if not then shortly after. Maybe if we suddenly destroy them in the AI race we will leave them in the dust. But they work way harder, save more money. Their savings gets invested in gov infrastructure building roads and buildings and airports while we spend it on axe throwing and escape rooms and subscription snack boxes. We have no manufacturing infrastructure, it's completely gone. It's like not knowing how to cook and eating at a restaurant 100% of the time. It's fine when you have money and you get along with the restaurant. But when you go hungry and they don't like you anymore youre in a tough place If you at *least* know how to cook at home you come out okay. It's still fine to cook at home 20% of the time and eat out the rest of the time when you have money. At least youre not totally dependent Whether chinas culture better for humanity is a totally different topic but reality is we can't serve the idealism of free international trade and free aid for everyone and low taxes for the rich bc the international stage is competitive. All those evils exist fundamentally bc we have other countries to worry about Mar 4, 2025, 5:08:13 PM Central Time
Me: Trump's personality has also very much changed since 4-8 yrs ago. Ppl who refuse to watch him won't notice, but he is different now Mar 4, 2025, 5:08:42 PM Central Time
Me: 2016 was about nostalgia. Make America great *again*. He never mentions that anymore. He doesn't talk about the past now, he talks about the future and only the future Mar 4, 2025, 5:09:54 PM Central Time
Me: Europeans departing is just posturing. Theyve been watching the way out media works and hopes the media will take down trump and destroy American confidence to force his hand and back down. Reality is they would never ever jeopardize the military protection we give Mar 4, 2025, 5:11:10 PM Central Time
Me: I don't think it's just voting fiscally tho. Gen z men came in big for trump. A lot of them are just getting started in the workforce, they don't have anything to compare it to. They are sick of being called racist misogynists Mar 4, 2025, 5:12:02 PM Central Time
Me: Gen z is way more conservative and less idealistic than us. Way more Mar 4, 2025, 5:26:01 PM Central Time
Me: this 1 min clip is worth a watch https://x.com/mazemoore/status/1574932485602828288 bill clinton said he had a good relationship with putin, then he's hailed as a diplomatic genius. trump has good relationship with putin, he's called a russian asset. more and more people are completely losing trust in the mainstream media. but i think less people realize we are very much being fed propaganda, anti-russia and anti-china i don't think the china now is the same communist china my parents escaped. china is no longer counterfeit central, chinese products are actually quite good and reliable, chinese companies have quite good customer service business principles. putin who knows but i don't think he's the complete psycho the media portrays him to be diplomacy based on "shared values" is on the decline. not much of a reason for us and russia to oppose each other much longer, unless russia prefers china as a close ally. america and europe are not christian nations anymore. russia is culturally more western. the only "idealism conflict" is against islamic states now. us and russia taking the same side in middle eastern conflict isn't actually the craziest thing in the world Mar 4, 2025, 5:27:47 PM Central Time
Me: as for the negatives of trump's opposition, i don't think ppl (democratic voters in the previous election who switched) blame or hate biden all that much. they hated kamala way more. she fully contributed to alienating white liberals who finally had enough Mar 4, 2025, 5:34:01 PM Central Time
Me: i don't think it's just voting fiscally bc most liberals, when you mentioned inflation during biden presidency, would say "actually inflation has gone down!" and they blame trump for it. so they don't even blame incumbency

Gautham Oroskar: Pay special attention to the part about education. Given this, why do most Asians Indians and Chinese push their kids to do so much education? Mar 5, 2025, 9:20:36 AM Central Time
Me: Lol Mar 5, 2025, 9:23:10 AM Central Time
Me: I can speak for Chinese, doing well on a test is baked into the history of the culture, whichever dynasty started the nationwide examination that allowed capable commoners who tested well to join the gov bureaucracy as a scholar. Now it's almost the same where their test score disproportionately determines their college entrance choices, way more than the act or sat does Mar 5, 2025, 9:25:52 AM Central Time
Me: Besides that I'm guessing it's prestige whoring. Chinese and Indians know the big names in education but don't know much about what comes after that, how money is made in America, how the meritocracy actually works, etc. So the only method of evaluating "success" to them is by school prestige and a select couple professions that are closely tied to that, med and law primarily. To a lesser extent "wall street" even if they have no idea what that means Mar 5, 2025, 9:29:11 AM Central Time
Me: If I had to speculate on any differences between the two, many more Indians live with spiritual values, while Chinese are very nonreligious. That might be a factor pushing indians toward healthcare even more than Chinese

Gautham Oroskar: Is what Bernie sanders said true? See below: It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them…. Will the big money interests and well-paid consultants who control the Democratic Party learn any real lessons from this disastrous campaign? Will they understand the pain and political alienation that tens of millions of Americans are experiencing? Do they have any ideas as to how we can take on the increasingly powerful Oligarchy, which has so much economic power? Answering his own questions, Bernie Sanders declared, “Probably not.” What do you puss? Mar 13, 2025, 3:46:43 PM Central Time

Gautham Oroskar: Would you argue that 9/11 was at least in part due to the effects of capitalism? How US wants to stick its hand into every possible area of the world to maximize its capitalistic goals and needs? The USA wants to protect its oil interests in the Middle East and prevented Iraq’s entry into Kuwait/Saudi Arabia because it know the value of middle eastern oil flow to the USA? Mar 16, 2025, 6:54:36 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: This was the sentiment of the Netflix documentary Turning Point: 9/11 and the War on Terror Mar 16, 2025, 6:56:11 PM Central Time

Me: And misplaced idealism
Gautham Oroskar: What will you puss today? Mar 17, 2025, 4:12:49 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: -the USA immediately moved to protect Saudi Arabia when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait just to make sure the USA’s oil and natural gas resources were protected. This enraged Bin Laden that the USA occupied land in holy Muslim territory in Saudi Arabia. Bin Laden saw no difference between Russia occupying Afghanistan in the early 1980s and the USA occupying Saudi Arabia. So he started a vendetta against USA to attack them. -but why did the USA move to protect Saudi Arabia, could it be capitalism? USA wanted to make sure its access to oil was well protected, for its own well being. Therefore, capitalism was an indirect factor at least behind Bin Laden’s hated to America and why he plotted 9/11.

Gautham Oroskar: This is what Gottumukkala told me: “Literally every single one of your arguments ties back to capitalism. What is your proposition for a better economic system? You think if the U.S. decides to aim for a communist utopia it will solve all of society’s complex ills?” Apr 2, 2025, 1:37:58 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: What do you puss? Apr 2, 2025, 1:38:25 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: “Ur worldview is that Modern capitalism is a major root cause of every shitty thing that happens.” “But I think other structural forces and the abstracted more complex layers of the relationship between capitalism and global human adversity is a more interesting discussion than the “people are concerned with money and therefore they do this shitty thing and that shitty thing” Apr 2, 2025, 2:25:07 PM Central Time

Gautham Oroskar: But what is your opinion on his text Apr 4, 2025, 3:19:31 PM Central Time
Me: I'm not so focused on people doing bad because of a system, because people do bad due to human nature. I do think UBI and massive permanent unemployment is an inevitability, we might even see it in our lifetime. But there is a legitimate question of how much scarcity we really have right now and how much of it is natural Apr 4, 2025, 3:26:05 PM Central Time
Me: Capitalism is too fundamental to focus on as "blame", I think it would be better to focus on consumerism instead. Thinking about capitalism as a cause would be like focusing on water being a liquid for why it does what it does. It is true, but too far down at the base of the causal chain. Looking at how consumerism has exploded in the last 100 years would be more like identifying the fact that water is a polar molecule that forms hydrogen bonds giving it the properties it does as a solvent and its high specific heat All capitalist systems have had varying levels of consumerist behavior and prosperity, but the dominance of mass media and its dictation of culture has amplified consumerism to an extraordinary degree Apr 4, 2025, 3:28:24 PM Central Time
Me: It used to be we were chopping down too many forests bc of capitalism. Now it's more like, too many kids are sexting each other and becoming onlyfans models as soon as they can bc of capitalism. The difference between the two isn't that capitalism is any more or less relevant in the two scenarios, it's the complete dominance of consumerist culture that's emerged

Gautham Oroskar: How do you solve the massive trade deficit that has existed for decades if you do not increase tarrifs and lay off federal employees? At least trump is trying something that every other president just kicks the can down the road? Apr 5, 2025, 11:32:36 AM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: I mean the national debt. What is an alternative solution to the rising national debt each year? The fact how China and India each year take away jobs for Americans because it’s cheaper labor there. That cycle just repeats itself with every next president. Is trump trying to combat that such a bad thing?
Me: If we didn't have trump doing this right now our country collapses within 20 years guaranteed. Tariffs and cuts are literally saving the country and giving it a fighting chance Apr 6, 2025, 2:51:30 AM Central Time
Me: It's shocking how critics won't even acknowledge that tariffs are always intended as a short term strategy to give American manufacturing a chance to start Apr 6, 2025, 2:52:55 AM Central Time
Me: These fed agencies are literally deep state if they can't be touched by the gov. Cutting them is fundamentally necessary Apr 6, 2025, 8:10:33 AM Central Time

Me: Trade war aside Americans buy way too much crap, and we don't have the money to do that anymore. So if it causes less consumption overall that's a good thing in itself

Gautham Oroskar: You can insert a different name, but the overall pathway is generally the same. Does that indicate a relative injustice or futility of time spent in those years of college tennis at university? Apr 19, 2025, 11:51:27 AM Central Time
Me: Lol Apr 19, 2025, 11:52:50 AM Central Time

Me: Anything could be filed but I don't think there's any way to prove that the explicit purpose and promise of the service was to produce professional tennis players to where anything less than that should be considered a failure of the service
Gautham Oroskar: See the underlying theme there: “but hey, they have a business to run.”… Apr 25, 2025, 12:32:12 PM Central Time

Gautham Oroskar: He claims that it's our problem if we miscalculated that we were going to be professional tennis players. We should have never believed that to begin with, despite the heavy amount of time and money we and our parents spent. Apr 30, 2025, 7:47:33 AM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: He said that we had enough agency to make the choice to play college tennis at UIC, and HRC simply "embellishes" it's arsenal of the top players in Illinois as a marketing tool, but it is not deceptive or fraudulent Apr 30, 2025, 7:47:48 AM Central Time

Gautham Oroskar: Do you think it’s possible to learn how to become a Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, or Mukesh Ambani from school? From anything you learned in middle school/high school/undergrad/professional school or even MBA? If you think the answer is no, do you think that that is ridiculous? What did school teach them in their path to becoming visionary billionaires? May 15, 2025, 7:35:26 PM Central Time
Me: Weak correlation, prob can't claim zero correlation May 15, 2025, 7:42:09 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: What correlation do you speak of? May 15, 2025, 7:42:23 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: That not going to school is a better chance of becoming a billionaire? May 15, 2025, 7:43:33 PM Central Time

Gautham Oroskar: Why do you say weak correlation? May 15, 2025, 8:03:09 PM Central Time
Me: Its a completely different skillset that doesn't really transfer but it probably doesn't hurt May 15, 2025, 8:03:35 PM Central Time
Me: Not going to school may or may not be better, I think that's all just situational based on which opportunity is being compared to which
Gautham Oroskar: That's what I pussed to Ravi. What do you puss? May 16, 2025, 8:45:32 AM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: You keep bringing up the fact that these people are outliers and policy for the masses cannot be modeled off of outliers. What I am arguing is that going to formal education and schooling deters people from thinking like entrepreneurs. When you are constantly taking exams and fighting to get an A or get the highest score on the test, you are conditioned with the goal in mind that the successful end result of school is to work for someone else, to be a highly paid employee for someone else, to be told what to work on, when to work on something, and to be told how much you will be paid by someone. That’s the goal of school that was drilled into our heads from youth. Now, you can argue to me that those entrepreneurs only had a 1% chance of success to begin with. But by going to school, your chances of achieving what those entrepreneurs did are 0%. You have no chance at all if your whole framework is centered around what school conditions you to. You will most likely always work for someone else until you retire. May 16, 2025, 1:53:07 PM Central Time
Me: That can possibly be true too May 16, 2025, 1:54:15 PM Central Time
Me: Some schools do create very valuable networking opportunities tho. But ya I would say that dynamic itself is definitely true, about the conditioning. As for whether that makes school *overall* positive or negative, it's hard to say

Gautham Oroskar: Would you think less of me of a friend if I told you that my only purpose in life is to “sell what you're buying?” Or if someone says to me at a party when we are both meeting each other for the first time: what do you like to do for fun?” Or “what do you do?” And I say, “what I like is to do is sell what you’re buying.” How would react if you asked that to someone and that’s how they responded to your question? May 17, 2025, 6:24:34 PM Central Time

Gautham Oroskar: What will you puss today?
Gautham Oroskar: What will you puss today?
Gautham Oroskar: What will you puss today? Jul 7, 2025, 11:56:49 AM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: The Tennis and pickle ball instruction industry wants to sell you the concept that one more purchase, one more racquet, one more private lesson, one more shoe purchase, is all you need to become Djokovic or Ben Johns. Even though the instructors and business owners who sell you this concept know internally that whom they are selling to has zero chance of being who you see on television. Doesn’t that sound so fundamentally and morally wrong?
Gautham Oroskar: What will you puss today?
Gautham Oroskar: What will you puss today? Jul 11, 2025, 2:57:08 PM Central Time
Me: I think it's reasonable to expect ppl to set their own expectations on how far they will go, especially something as speculative as going pro. The knowledge asymmetry in the industry isn't as massive as it is in say medicine or law, and the person doing the bulk of the work is the client not the professional. Do I also think tennis has a lot of scumbags and frauds? Yes absolutely, I do think they take advantage of parents' optimism, but I'm not too focused on blaming them Jul 11, 2025, 2:58:08 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: I’m not taking about someone like Krishna Nalla. While your point is valid and well taken, I’m talking about someone like you or me. Someone who was competitive in tennis and gave significant effort and time towards it. Krishna Nalla doesn’t really care about tennis more than a recreation at the end of the day. For people like us, were we not deceived by clubs like midtown or Hinsdale racquet club? Promoting that they were “the best” and created “National champions” that in reality today, are no where close to the level of caliber of tennis you see on TV. In fact, most of those competitive tennis juniors who played at those clubs have little to no interest in continuing to play tennis. It’s almost like that pathway causes one to lose interest in tennis later on in life. What do you puss? Jul 11, 2025, 2:58:13 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: This is what I pussed back to Rahul Kamath from his response, what do you puss? Jul 11, 2025, 3:01:04 PM Central Time
Me: I don't remember being sold on being a star or being on tv Jul 11, 2025, 3:01:29 PM Central Time
Me: If my parents ever asked a pro "how far do you think my son will go?" or anything like that, I don't remember being a part of any of those conversations so I can't say Jul 11, 2025, 3:02:59 PM Central Time
Me: There were kids who had great national success. But I don't remember anyone saying to me "yo jimmy you could be as good as Augie, you could be better" other than perhaps giving encouragement Jul 11, 2025, 3:04:07 PM Central Time
Me: As for losing interest in tennis later in life, I put more responsibility on the parents and the overall sports/college admissions culture of our society Jul 11, 2025, 3:05:12 PM Central Time
Me: I feel like the majority of competitive juniors I knew weren't interested in tennis on a personal level. We wouldn't have played if not for the expected societal rewards Jul 11, 2025, 3:05:54 PM Central Time
Me: Those who did have interest in tennis, prob more likely to play in adulthood Jul 11, 2025, 3:15:08 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Explain that to me further...what do you mean expected societal rewards and "overall sports/college admissions culture" of our society Jul 11, 2025, 3:16:01 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: I think what you're trying to say is that no matter how much you care or love of Tennis, at the end end of your young adulthood, you have to fit into the constraints of capitalism that American society places on you. And most of the time Tennis fits in poorly with such constraints, do people lose interest, but what does that mean about the thousands of dollars spent at Hinsdale racquet club for a potentially wasted endeavor? Jul 11, 2025, 3:16:27 PM Central Time
Me: "instead of paying for your school we'll pay for your opportunity to earn a scholarship" basically an extension of that mentality to culture. Our culture was raised on going to college being the goal of everything. That was the goal of tennis Jul 11, 2025, 3:17:11 PM Central Time
Me: Nah I think I'm a little more focused on the people who never would have played tennis in the first place if not for the rewards Jul 11, 2025, 3:17:28 PM Central Time
Me: Then yeah after college, even people who do like tennis have less incentive Jul 11, 2025, 3:18:01 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: So the whole point of the tens of thousands of dollars wasted at Hinesville racquet club on competitive junior players is to earn a college scholarship? To learn useless meaningless facts in a classroom that often times has no bearing of how you survive from capitalism in the future? What about actually pursuing competitive tennis since you're spending hundreds of thousands of hours playing and competing in tennis? Jul 11, 2025, 3:18:16 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Would you not argue that Tom Cahill and Jack Sharpe are wasting time and effort of all of these competitive juniors if it only amounts to "oh OK now you have a college scholarship to learn meaningless shit in the classroom." Jul 11, 2025, 3:19:10 PM Central Time
Me: I don't blame hrc for much, they basically gave me the best training I could possibly get within the 20 miles or so that was relatively feasible to drive to regularly Jul 11, 2025, 3:19:24 PM Central Time
Me: Yes Jul 11, 2025, 3:19:29 PM Central Time
Me: Which is wrong Jul 11, 2025, 3:19:48 PM Central Time
Me: I think society has it wrong. Youth sports should be about building character. Not earning a scholarship Jul 11, 2025, 3:20:39 PM Central Time
Me: Parents and society lose the forest for the trees. Became an obsessive, life or death struggle for every ranking point you could get Jul 11, 2025, 3:22:18 PM Central Time
Me: No, I don't think they're wasting time and effort, because sports for the vast 99.9999% of people will be for any benefit that's not turning pro. If they were bad at managing expectations then yes they share some responsibility. But kids learn a lot competing at that level, and it wasn't all for nothing Jul 11, 2025, 3:22:59 PM Central Time
Me: The problem with college scholarships is more of a problem with the current state of college itself. And specific to men's tennis, a gross overestimation among the populace of how much money is actually available Jul 11, 2025, 3:23:23 PM Central Time
Me: My perspective would be a bit different for girls Jul 11, 2025, 3:28:30 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: But you don't think that Jack sharper Tom Cahill bear some of their responsibility for promoting that culture of oh keep paying us money every week after week after week tens of thousands of dollars and will get your kid a college scholarship to play college tennis. When the underlying current of the theme really means "your kid is gonna have to find another endeavor and activity in life in order to earn money and survive. Don't think it's gonna be through competing in tennis and winning matches to earn money. The only way you're going to earn money in the Tennis industry is by feeding balls to stock up wealthy junior's as a tennis pro." That's the undercurrent statement that no one ever wants to bring out, all they want to promote is: "We're a high performance super excellence tennis club and look at the tennis pros that are on TV in the lobby." Jul 11, 2025, 3:32:58 PM Central Time
Me: The price they charged was the price parents were more than willing to pay. People spend almost that much on daycare now let alone competitive tennis training. People spend on QB coaches, travel baseball, dance lessons, all sorts of whatever for their kids now because the competition to enter college has just climbed to such ridiculous sky high levels Jul 11, 2025, 3:34:01 PM Central Time
Me: Could they have charged less? Probably, I don't know what their books look like. But I don't think *that* much less Jul 11, 2025, 3:34:42 PM Central Time
Me: Competitive junior tennis generally costs more than it's worth "for tennis clubs I mean" which is why the vast majority of tennis clubs support recreational tennis and do not even try to support a competitive junior program Jul 11, 2025, 3:35:37 PM Central Time
Me: I wouldn't blame Cahill or Sharpe to the degree that I would blame a doctor or a lawyer, for irresponsibly guaranteeing success of a risky surgery or guaranteeing victory in court that is not assured Jul 11, 2025, 3:36:04 PM Central Time
Me: Not to the same level Jul 11, 2025, 3:36:31 PM Central Time
Me: Parents have more responsibility for their kids than patients do for their medical choices Jul 11, 2025, 3:39:19 PM Central Time
Me: What I do think they were more guilty of was favoritism Jul 11, 2025, 3:40:24 PM Central Time
Me: We paid the same price (presumably) but some kids got more coach hitting privileges than others, some had to play grunt matches more than others Jul 11, 2025, 3:40:25 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: So for me to be granted admissions to college to learn physics and organic chemistry and finance, I should pay money playing the Midwest closed and travel baseball and dance lessons? How does the money spent on these activities, not just for competitive tennis, allow me to pass my organic chemistry test and math class and finance class in college? Furthermore, how does playing in the Midwest closed allow me to survive the perils of daily capitalism and the constraints that capitalism places on my life? Why would I spend my energy at Hinsdale racquet club if I'm forced into capitalism after age 18? Jul 11, 2025, 3:41:02 PM Central Time
Me: It doesn't. That's what I think is wrong now about society's model for college, career, etc Jul 11, 2025, 3:41:27 PM Central Time
Me: But basically yeah, doing those things is almost required now to get a chance Jul 11, 2025, 3:41:35 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: No one can answer me the question of how the pros you see on the TV actually came from less opportunities than the juniors who played at Hinsdale racquet club. Why is it that people who played tennis with less opportunity growing up than we did are the ones who were more successful with competitive tennis and making millions of dollars playing tennis today. While all the wealthy Hinsdale juniors who played tennis at Hinsdale racquet club want very little to do with tennis today, and have to survive within capitalism with an activity that is completely different than Tennis. Jul 11, 2025, 3:42:27 PM Central Time
Me: Well to compare apples to apples and look at the best American players compared to us, most of them went academy at least at some point Jul 11, 2025, 3:43:19 PM Central Time
Me: As for why there are more top players from other countries than America, that's another story Jul 11, 2025, 3:43:44 PM Central Time
Me: Djokovic may have started poor but at *some* point, someone had to pay for him to travel to tournaments Jul 11, 2025, 3:44:43 PM Central Time
Me: I don't think it's a general trend that less opportunity => greater success. I have no way of actually knowing, but I don't think that's the case Jul 11, 2025, 3:45:23 PM Central Time
Me: Hrc super ex may have cost more *money* than a kid in Spain hitting with a pro every day, but that kid in Spain is getting way better training Jul 11, 2025, 3:51:28 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Right that's what I'm trying to say is the biggest problem that I am bringing up. I'm paying more money in America to get worse and potentially detrimental Tennis training. And Hinsdale racquet club is happy to keep feeding me that deceit that they were giving me excellent training when all I see is most juniors stop or lose interest in tennis after age 18. Meanwhile, a kid in Spain is paying less money and is getting better of training more targeted disciplined training where his tennis weaknesses are being improved on and the academy where he is training isn't only thinking about how they're going to maximize their profit margins Jul 11, 2025, 3:53:01 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Is that not deceitful or scamming? Hinsdale racquet club knows internally that these players have zero chance of any meaningful competitive Tennis beyond juniors. We are actually one of the few who competed in college tennis. Yet they ensure that everyone continues to pay them for us and their services. Jul 11, 2025, 3:53:41 PM Central Time
Me: Lol did you write that? Jul 11, 2025, 3:56:14 PM Central Time
Me: We pay more money because we are privileged spoiled Americans who have more money than we should. No wonder why China and the rest of the world wants access to the American consumer. Hrc represents that well being in, well, Hinsdale of all places Jul 11, 2025, 3:56:43 PM Central Time
Me: Comparatively it is better training than anywhere else in the area tho Jul 11, 2025, 3:56:55 PM Central Time
Me: It's a local market Jul 11, 2025, 3:57:52 PM Central Time
Me: I do think Jack was the real deal for developing 7-14s strokes Jul 11, 2025, 3:58:30 PM Central Time
Me: The Spain thing is the benefit of a rich sports tradition in an area Jul 11, 2025, 3:58:52 PM Central Time
Me: You could make an analogy saying that about Wheaton football on a local scale Jul 11, 2025, 4:00:14 PM Central Time
Me: That post is wrong about tennis being the worst sport to invest in. It's pretty bad for *boys*. But for girls it's actually pretty decent Jul 11, 2025, 4:11:07 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: So you disagree with everything in that post? Jul 11, 2025, 4:11:14 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: Nothing they said is true? Jul 11, 2025, 4:12:03 PM Central Time
Me: Just the part about tennis being the worst pick out of all the sports, that's a little overly simplistic Jul 11, 2025, 4:12:18 PM Central Time
Me: The rest are just their experiences which I'm not surprised by and would probably be consistent with mine
Gautham Oroskar: What will you puss today? Jul 13, 2025, 10:30:08 AM Central Time
Me: Fantasize about taco bell Jul 13, 2025, 10:30:17 AM Central Time
Me: Talk to God about whether there will be taco Bell in heaven Jul 13, 2025, 4:43:09 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: When can you play tennis this week? Jul 13, 2025, 4:43:49 PM Central Time
Me: Tues if we get taco bell
Gautham Oroskar: But in reference to your previous answer, you don't think that Jack Sharp and Tom Cahill clearly take advantage of that excessive well-being that families around the Hinsdale area have? They know that these families are wealthy and have money, and are happy to open their wallets to spend on junior tennis. Tom and Jack know that none of these players will accomplish anything meaningly and competitive tennis beyond winning a few local and/or Midwest tournaments nothing to the effect where they will earn millions from Tennis. So why do they promote their junior Tennis as a competitive super excellence Tennis environment? Why can't they simply promote it as an environment where you will become equipped with life skills for another profession in life? Jul 14, 2025, 2:12:48 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: What will you puss today? Jul 14, 2025, 4:25:27 PM Central Time
Me: No, I don't think they do Jul 14, 2025, 4:25:42 PM Central Time
Me: Because the philosophy behind why you're playing tennis is primarily parental responsibility, not coach Jul 14, 2025, 4:25:56 PM Central Time
Me: Parents choose the coach anyway. So the coach has little say Jul 14, 2025, 4:26:28 PM Central Time
Me: As for price-wise, no, I think that's just part of the business of selling to the rich Jul 14, 2025, 4:26:51 PM Central Time
Me: Charge what you dare to deliver on Jul 14, 2025, 4:27:49 PM Central Time

Me: In 2024 perhaps, 2016 not so much

Gautham Oroskar: What do you puss about this quote? Steve Jobs last words. 🙏 In 2011 Steve Jobs died at the age of 56 from pancreatic cancer, leaving a fortune of 7 billion dollars, these are some of his last words... “At this moment, lying in bed, sick and remembering my whole life, I realize that all the recognition and wealth I have is meaningless in the face of imminent death. I have the money to hire the best at any task, but it is not possible to hire someone to carry my disease. Money can get you all kinds of material things, but there is one thing you can't buy: "LIFE". As I got older, I realized that a $300 watch and a $3,000,000 watch show the same time. That with a $50,000 car and a $15,000,000 car, we can reach the same destination. That a wine of $150 or one of $1500, generate the same "hangover." That in a house of 300 square meters, or in one of 3000, the loneliness is the same." "True happiness does not come from material things, it comes from the affection that our loved ones give us."

Gautham Oroskar: What will you puss today? Aug 2, 2025, 1:19:38 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: I think it’s an obvious answer. You and I both know those facts are correct. My larger point is that Indian parents or parents in general don’t even want their kids to try entrepreneurship. Instead of learning how to sell a product and having a chance at making a much larger profit then you ever could in medicine, there is an inertial push to go into a safe, respected career, where the overall goal is to be a highly paid employee for a large hospital corporation. Where all you have to do is rinse and repeat what you trained in your residency or fellowship and earn a stable paycheck every 2 weeks. Aug 2, 2025, 1:20:27 PM Central Time
Me: Imo Asian parents don't realize themselves it's not even money they care about. It's status/prestige Aug 2, 2025, 1:20:40 PM Central Time

Gautham Oroskar: What do you puss? Aug 2, 2025, 1:21:00 PM Central Time

Gautham Oroskar: You don't think HRC bears any responsibility ? Aug 2, 2025, 1:28:03 PM Central Time
Me: It's a competitive sport, the motivation and everything is within the context of that. It should be contained. I don't blame the coaches so much if the player/parents lose the context Aug 2, 2025, 1:28:10 PM Central Time
Gautham Oroskar: None? Aug 2, 2025, 1:28:22 PM Central Time

Gautham Oroskar: But why won't Tom Cahill or HRC tell the player: "You're not good enough to end up like Federer or djokovic, I recommend you stop taking private lessons with me and focus on another medium for your survival within capitalism. I am okay if by stopping private lessons with me that means I stop receiving money from you." Aug 2, 2025, 1:30:41 PM Central Time
